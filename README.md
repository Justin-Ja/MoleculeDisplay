# MoleculeDisplay
A fullstack project that allows a user to display and rotate a molecule in 3D.

This web app allows the user to upload a .sdf file to be saved within the database.
The user can also fill out a form to color each element to be a specific color.
Finally the user can display the molecule and then rotate it in three dimensions.

Example image of a caffiene moecule that the app would display:
